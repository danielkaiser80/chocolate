# Chocolate Challenge

For the crazy chocolate junkies, this app provides a frontend to look for chocolate information, and links to buy the chocolates. As an addon, the app finds the cheapest store for each of the different types of chocolate.

The app itself is just a proof of concept, so instead of a real backend, there is some mock data included.

Feel free to fork and / or add a backend.

## Open issues and potential improvements

- add a way to deploy, preferably using Docker
- verify the integrity of the installed npm packages
- verify the API
- add exception handler
- style the 404 page in a nicer way
